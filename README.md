It was showing a graph of training data for linear regression, but when I changed to test train method it stopped working and threw errors based on input which I wasn't sure how to fix--cutting the rows didn't do anything.

#part 6. make argument.
# I believe that logistic regression would've worked better if i had managed to get the error out of my code,
#I think it woudl handle the multiple different types of vairables
#to predict calories better than linear regression, which has a very simplistic
#approach to prediction.
